I&rsquo;m a long time Linux person, been daily driving it since high school (2002), and I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed it.</p><p>Over the last years I started to buy into the Apple ecosystem bullshit everyone talks about, and so I bought my first iPhone XS Max, a bulky phone with an OK camera and a weird OS.</p><p>Coming from Android it was a strange experience not having a back button, sometimes I wouldn&rsquo;t understand why my app had two back buttons at the top on iOS, it is something that always felt like an afterthought from Apple. But I kept using the phone anyways as I didn&rsquo;t intend to spend more money in buying back a different one. I couldn&rsquo;t really understand how the notifications worked too, in Android they all made sense, you would swipe from top and have a list of notifications, but on iOS it would take me to my welcome screen?</p><p>And then I bought my Apple TV, great, 4K, with a sleek UI, but the remote control was just a mess, everytime I would pick it up I would accidentally fast forward (or backwards) my movie or TV show. Fine I can just use my iPhone to control the TV, right? Yeah, except whenever someone else in the house was watching TV and went to search something my iPhone would show me an annoying notification to input text from my phone and breaking my flow on whatever I was doing with my phone at the time.</p><p>This year I decided to buy a macbook pro m1, because why not? Everyone was talking about how impressed they were with this new Apple&rsquo;s silicon cpu. It is a great little machine and works pretty well for a laptop this size, and being honest I never heard the fans turning on (maybe they came broken?). And since then I tought my mac would be integrated with my iPhone (12 pro now), but somehow it never happened, I never see my texts or incoming calls showing over macOS when I&rsquo;m on my laptop. I&rsquo;ve tried enabling some stuff that I read on the internet, but it didn&rsquo;t help much.</p><p>And then the last straw comes in when I decided to buy a pair of airpods pro to help me filtering out noise, they won&rsquo;t stay in my ears, even using the smaller tips. I bought some foam tips trying to fix the issue, but that didn&rsquo;t work as well. Also they have some weird glitch whenever I turn my head I can hear a pop coming from the airpods. Sometimes they will pair with my mac but no sound will come out of it, so I have to disconnect and connect them again.</p><p>In the past years trying to buy into Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem I&rsquo;ve always felt annoyed by Apple&rsquo;s design decisions, like Finder never showing user&rsquo;s home on the favorites and myself having to do some weird flex to add it there. Now my iPhone, starting from iOS 15 will be able to spy on me without my consent (great!).</p><p>I think using Apple products never clicked for me, maybe it is because I&rsquo;m a power user, who likes to do stuff my way instead of being forced to do it the way Apple thinks it is best for their average user. I&rsquo;m glad I still have other pcs running Linux and that there are people working on bringing Linux to the M1 macs. I&rsquo;m ready to start the transition back to PC and leave Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem (which never worked for me anyways). I will keep my macbook pro m1 and sell the rest of my Apple stuff.</p></body></html>
