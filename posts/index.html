<h3><a class=title href=/posts/why-i-am-not-buying-apple-products-anymore/>Why I am not buying Apple products anymore</a></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;m not buying any Apple products anymore, and here are my reasons. I&rsquo;m a long time Linux person, been daily driving it since high school (2002), and I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed it.
Over the last years I started to buy into the Apple ecosystem bullshit everyone talks about, and so I bought my first iPhone XS Max, a bulky phone with an OK camera and a weird OS.
Coming from Android it was a strange experience not having a back button, sometimes I wouldn&rsquo;t understand why my app had two back buttons at the top on iOS, it is something that always felt like an afterthought from Apple.</p>

<h3><a class=title href=/posts/restarting-my-blog/>Restarting My Blog</a></h3>
<p>Hello, World! Hello everybody, I&rsquo;ve decided to restart my blog to share my hobbies. This will be a place for me to write stuff that I may need to revisit in the future, or simply to get it out of my head and out into the cyberspace :P
In the following days I will be republishing old stuff that I&rsquo;ve written in my previous blog. BTW, I recently joined Mastodon and it has been a breath of fresh air, I got tired of the busy feed on twitter and decided to reconnect with my roots in free software and open source.</p>
