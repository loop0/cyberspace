<h3><a class=title href=/posts/restarting-my-blog/>Restarting My Blog</a></h3>
<p>Hello, World! Hello everybody, I&rsquo;ve decided to restart my blog to share my hobbies. This will be a place for me to write stuff that I may need to revisit in the future, or simply to get it out of my head and out into the cyberspace :P
In the following days I will be republishing old stuff that I&rsquo;ve written in my previous blog. BTW, I recently joined Mastodon and it has been a breath of fresh air, I got tired of the busy feed on twitter and decided to reconnect with my roots in free software and open source.</p>
