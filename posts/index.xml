The attacks that fastmail (my current email provider for this domain) have been taking lately also contributed to the decision of hosting email on my own.
Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for many years in the past as a network/sysadmin and I&amp;rsquo;ve had to admin servers with thousands and thousands of email accounts.</description></item><item><title>Why I am not buying Apple products anymore</title><link>https://loop0.sh/posts/why-i-am-not-buying-apple-products-anymore/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 10:21:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://loop0.sh/posts/why-i-am-not-buying-apple-products-anymore/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;m not buying any Apple products anymore, and here are my reasons. I&amp;rsquo;m a long time Linux person, been daily driving it since high school (2002), and I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed it.
Over the last years I started to buy into the Apple ecosystem bullshit everyone talks about, and so I bought my first iPhone XS Max, a bulky phone with an OK camera and a weird OS.
Coming from Android it was a strange experience not having a back button, sometimes I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why my app had two back buttons at the top on iOS, it is something that always felt like an afterthought from Apple.</description></item><item><title>Restarting My Blog</title><link>https://loop0.sh/posts/restarting-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 13:19:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://loop0.sh/posts/restarting-my-blog/</guid><description>Hello, World! Hello everybody, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to restart my blog to share my hobbies. This will be a place for me to write stuff that I may need to revisit in the future, or simply to get it out of my head and out into the cyberspace :P
In the following days I will be republishing old stuff that I&amp;rsquo;ve written in my previous blog. BTW, I recently joined Mastodon and it has been a breath of fresh air, I got tired of the busy feed on twitter and decided to reconnect with my roots in free software and open source.</description></item></channel></rss>
