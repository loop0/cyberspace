<h1>Restarting My Blog</h1>
<h1 id=hello-world>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>Hello everybody, I&rsquo;ve decided to restart my blog to share my hobbies.
This will be a place for me to write stuff that I may need to revisit in the future, or simply to get it out of my head and out into the cyberspace :P</p>
<p>In the following days I will be republishing old stuff that I&rsquo;ve written in my previous blog. BTW, I recently joined Mastodon and it has been a breath of fresh air, I got tired of the busy feed on twitter and decided to reconnect with my roots in free software and open source.</p>
<p>The folks at <a href=https://fosstodon.org/>fosstodon</a> are very nice people, so I encourage you to join too! Feel free to follow me there <code>@loop0</code>.</p>
<p>About my hobbies, ever since I moved to US I&rsquo;ve started collecting retro stuff, like old video game consoles, and I&rsquo;ve got very interested in console modding as well, so a few months later and I already modified my Sony Playstation with a <a href=https://www.black-dog.tech/ps1digital.html>ps1digital</a> and an <a href=https://castlemaniagames.com/products/xstation>xstation</a> kit, a Sega Dreamcast with <a href=https://www.black-dog.tech/dcdigital.html>dcdigital</a> and a <a href=https://gdemu.wordpress.com>gdemu</a>. I also converted my Gamecube DOL-101 analog port to a <a href=https://www.black-dog.tech/gamecube-dol-101-digital-port-upgrade-kit.html>digital port</a>. It has been a fun ride learning electronics and soldering a long the way.</p>
<p>Besides that, my interest in mechanical watches grew over the past years and I&rsquo;ve started collecting watches and studying about watch history. I guess it is a way to do something out of the digital world and I feel good about it.</p>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been doing some research on reverse engineering, which I want to apply to a product that I have which only can be updated via Windows. I&rsquo;m trying to figure out if I can get some code to make the flashing process working on linux as well. I will definitely make a post here with my findings on this subject.</p>
<p>Alright, I feel I&rsquo;m done writing for this first post.</p>
