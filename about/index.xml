I use this space to post about a few things that I do in my spare time
that I think could be useful to some random netizen. I&amp;rsquo;m not great at writing so I like to keep things
short and sweet. I love all things operating systems and programming languages. My pronouns are he/him/his. My operating systems of choices are &lt;strong>centos&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>debian&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>fedora&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>freebsd&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>openbsd&lt;/strong>, not in any specific order but whenever it is the right tool for the job. The programming languages that I most use are python, ruby and go.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
