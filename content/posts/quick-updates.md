Soooo, decided to write a quick update on what is going on:

* The self hosted email server worked for a year before I decided to take it down due to lots of maintenances required. 
Servers started to refuse my email all of a sudden, it was an unending race to change configurations and make fixes.
I decided to go back to gmail for now.
* I moved my mastodon account from fosstodon to freeradical, now you can find me `@loop0@freeradical.zone`
* I started studying kafka and decided to create a cluster with kvm machines, but with automated provisioning using ansible and cloudinit. I also found out that virtualization is a rabbit hole. I will probably write a post to document some funky stuff that
I learned along the way.
* I need to upgrade my workstation to have more RAM (who would have thought?)
* I am updating this blog with new content
