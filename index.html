Quick Updates</h3><p>Soooo, decided to write a quick update on what is going on:
The self hosted email server worked for a year before I decided to take it down due to losts of maintenances required. Servers start to refuse my email all of a sudden, it was an unending race to change configurations and make fixes. I decided to go back to gmail for now. I moved my mastdon account from fosstodon to freeradical, now you can find me @loop0@freeradical.</p><p><a href=/posts/quick-updates/>Continue reading...</a></p><h3><span>2021-10-23</span>
Owning my email server</h3><p>A couple weeks ago I decided I should start de-googling and owning my own stuff on the internet, I thought it would be a good exercise to start by hosting my own email server. The attacks that fastmail (my current email provider for this domain) have been taking lately also contributed to the decision of hosting email on my own.
Disclaimer: I&rsquo;ve worked for many years in the past as a network/sysadmin and I&rsquo;ve had to admin servers with thousands and thousands of email accounts.</p><p><a href=/posts/owning-my-email-server/>Continue reading...</a></p><h3><span>2021-10-22</span>
Why I am not buying Apple products anymore</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;m not buying any Apple products anymore, and here are my reasons. I&rsquo;m a long time Linux person, been daily driving it since high school (2002), and I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed it.
Over the last years I started to buy into the Apple ecosystem bullshit everyone talks about, and so I bought my first iPhone XS Max, a bulky phone with an OK camera and a weird OS.
Coming from Android it was a strange experience not having a back button, sometimes I wouldn&rsquo;t understand why my app had two back buttons at the top on iOS, it is something that always felt like an afterthought from Apple.</p><p><a href=/posts/why-i-am-not-buying-apple-products-anymore/>Continue reading...</a></p></body></html>
