I Am Building a Cyberdeck</h3><p>Ever since I got myself a 3D printer I&rsquo;ve been looking for a few projects. I decided to build a cyberdeck and this is going to be good opportunity to learn how to make CAD models. And because tinkering with electronics is something I do as a hobby I think it will be an entertaining project. This is what I decided so far for the project:
An 8.8 inch screen with 1920x480 resolution A Raspberry Pi Zero W 2 for the computing power A custom 40% ortholinear custom keyboard to keep the size of the cyberdeck small Custom 3D printed case A PCB to make a faceplate/bezel for the screen, I think it will look cool and I can put some text/art, perhaps even some function stuff, like on/off LED&mldr; I am not yet set if I want io ports in the cyberdeck, and also if it will have internal battery or if I should just use a portable external battery and have one usb micro port for power/battery.</p><p><a href=/posts/i-am-building-a-cyberdeck/>Continue reading...</a></p><h3><span>2022-12-06</span>
Quick Updates</h3><p>Soooo, decided to write a quick update on what is going on:
The self hosted email server worked for a year before I decided to take it down due to lots of maintenances required. Servers started to refuse my email all of a sudden, it was an unending race to change configurations and make fixes. I decided to go back to gmail for now. I moved my mastodon account from fosstodon to freeradical, now you can find me @loop0@freeradical.</p><p><a href=/posts/quick-updates/>Continue reading...</a></p><h3><span>2021-10-23</span>
Owning my email server</h3><p>A couple weeks ago I decided I should start de-googling and owning my own stuff on the internet, I thought it would be a good exercise to start by hosting my own email server. The attacks that fastmail (my current email provider for this domain) have been taking lately also contributed to the decision of hosting email on my own.
Disclaimer: I&rsquo;ve worked for many years in the past as a network/sysadmin and I&rsquo;ve had to admin servers with thousands and thousands of email accounts.</p><p><a href=/posts/owning-my-email-server/>Continue reading...</a></p></body></html>
